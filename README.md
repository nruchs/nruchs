# Hi there! I'm Natalia Ruchs üëã

## üöÄ About Me & My Work

I am a **Full Stack Developer** focused on creating high-quality, scalable solutions for **B2C e-commerce** within the **Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC)** ecosystem. My work involves developing and maintaining key functionalities, with a strong emphasis on user experience improvement, performance, and stability.

I specialize in:
* Designing and integrating **APIs** (OCAPI/SCAPI) in Salesforce environments.
* Back-End development with **JavaScript** and **Node.js**.
* Monitoring, control, and performance optimization of services.

**In my free time**, I channel my passion for coding into personal projects and actively contributing to **Open Source** initiatives. This GitHub space is where I share these public tools, experiments, and community contributions.
